The Bionic C Library
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a fork of the Bionic C Library from the Android Open Source Project.

The original code can be found here[1].

Purpose
=-=-=-=

The purpose of this fork is to allow 3rd party developers to use bionic as
their primary system C library.

The initial port, Gentoo-Bionic[2], mostly focused on Gentoo Linux[3] although
the migration to autotools minimizes that tight coupling. This codebase is
now Linux-distribution-agnostic and therefore can be used (in theory) with any
Linux distribution.

License
=-=-=-=

One of the advantages of using bionic is that it is BSD-licensed (see the file
COPYING). This provides greater flexibility for hardware and software product
vendors when compared with other free-as-in-speach licenses. Indeed, bionic
allows you to have your free-as-in-beer software and use it too.

Since the BSD license has more permissive licensing constraints for API
consumers, people can freely write both open and proprietary software which
links to bionic without much concern of licensing restrictions. However,
please keep in mind, that if Program A links to bionic and Library B,
regardless of whether Library B links to bionic, then Program A still must
abide by the terms and conditions of the Library B software license.

Occasionally, this fork of bionic might incorporate files from other projects
that are similarly permissively licensed. For any questions regarding software
licensing, please email gentoobionic@gmail.com .

Modifications
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1) Use autotools to build rather than the Android build system
2) Use common prefixes for the runtime (e.g. /usr instead of /system)
3) Remove any dependencies on the Android runtime and revert to more
   traditional UNIX practices (e.g. use /etc/resolv.conf instead of
   Android's properties for DNS servers)
4) Add more system calls and libc functions, as appropriate

More information can be found from the original ELC2013 presentation [4].


Happy hacking!
