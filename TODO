TODO
=-=-

0) Add headers to install targets (note: gentoo-bionic had a separate 
   bionic-kernel-headers package)
1) maybe block arm build right now, until .arm file extension is sorted out
   - identify and properly compile .thumb / .arm compilation targets
   - generate rules
2) change the behaviour of /bin/linker - I want this to be more like ld-linux.so
   - this means it should work as a drop-in replacement with ldd(1)
   - also a rename to /lib/ld-linux.so would be awesome
   - net result is that people can use the same semantics as a -gnu* toolchain
3) modify the crt*.o, possibly, so that we don't need an -mbionic 
   - rename crt*.o to be compatible with crti.o, crt1.o, crtn.o, etc
   - net result is that people can use the same semantics as a -gnu* toolchain
4) add a testsuite
   - or use an existing one, e.g. http://posixtest.sourceforge.net/

FEATURE REQUESTS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

0) update to bionic-4.4 (kitkat)
1) a more padded-out libc - lots of those random libc funcs that ever 139th package requires
2) possibly wchar.h support with a shim-layer to icu4c
   - dlopen? - automatically pulling in that library would be serious heavy lifting
3) additional syscall support
4) SELF-HOSTING: LLVM / Clang is where I'm leaning
   - get GCC running on top of bionic
5) should we require python as a build tool? ... gensyscalls in C with BUILDCC?
