TODO

-2) change gensyscalls.py to output into build directory
-1) build properly in a different build directory (maybe works already?)
   - this did work, it might be broken now
0) build without any interruptions
   - should not complain about any undefined references with e.g. make -j7
1) gensyscalls.py should actually generate all the syscalls
   - currently 'make' has to be run twice for everything to successfully compile
   - need to debug that make step
2) verify linkage entirely, using custom linker rules in Makefile.am
   - see http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/crt.txt
   - that means, I should be able to drop it in my /usr/i686-pc-linux-bionic chroot
     and it should Just Work (TM)
3) Add install targets
4) Add headers to install targets (note: gentoo-bionic had a separate 
   bionic-kernel-headers package)
5) maybe block arm build right now, until .arm file extension is sorted out
   - identify and properly compile .thumb / .arm compilation targets
   - generate rules
6) change the behaviour of /sbin/linker - I want this to be more like ld-linux.so
   - this means it should work as a drop-in replacement with ldd(1)
   - also a rename to /lib/ld-linux.so would be awesome
   - net result is that people can use the same semantics as a -gnu* toolchain
7) modify the crt*.o, possibly, so that we don't need an -mbionic 
   - rename crt*.o to be compatible with crti.o, crt1.o, crtn.o, etc
   - net result is that people can use the same semantics as a -gnu* toolchain
8) add a testsuite
   - or use an existing one, e.g. http://posixtest.sourceforge.net/

FEATURE REQUESTS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

0) update to bionic-4.4 (kitkat)
1) a more padded-out libc - lots of those random libc funcs that ever 139th package requires
2) possibly wchar.h support with a shim-layer to icu4c
   - dlopen? - automatically pulling in that library would be serious heavy lifting
3) additional syscall support
4) SELF-HOSTING: LLVM / Clang is where I'm leaning
   - get GCC running on top of bionic
5) should we require python as a build tool? ... gensyscalls in C with BUILDCC?
